### File Notes

raw.data folder: 
  1. Contains the original quadrat data used. 
  2. It isn't technically the raw data of the original project, but it's the base for this project. Make sure to select the .csv when you   run the clean.

clean.data folder: 
  1. `clean.R` is necessary to run before the `strip charts.R`.
  2. All dataframes besides the raw are called from this folder.

analysis folder:
  1. `Scatter plots with regression.R` and `Species Richnes LM.R` contain the analysis for scatterplots and linear regressions.
  2. `strip charts.R` contains the ANOVA and strip chart analysis.
  3. The four .pdfs are the two strip charts and residual plots.
